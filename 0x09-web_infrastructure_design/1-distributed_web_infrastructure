- we added load balancer to optimize resource utilization, increase efficiency, and ensure high availability and reliability of applications or services.
The load balancer assigns connection to each server on the queue, if the last server on the queue is reached then it will start over from the beginning.

- our load balancer has an Active-Active setup to help it avoid problem if one of the servers fail

-Primary node or master node, serves a critical role in managing the database and handling client read and write operations

- The SPOF ( single point of failure) on the web infrastracture resides on the Load balances, since we have only one Load balancer where failure of it will
 result on failure of the whole web infrastructure.

- security issue:  we have no firewall and we are using http  so the infrastructure is not secured, hackers can easily access the server.
